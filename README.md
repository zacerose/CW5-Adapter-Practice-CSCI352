# CW5: Adapter Practice CSCI352
Name: Zachary Rose  
Date: 2/7/2023  
Class: CSCI 352

Basic code example showing the adapter structural design pattern, and a UML of the example.

## Required Files
* CW5-Adapter_Practice/ --> directory containing the project files
* CW5-Adapter_Practice.sln --> Visual Studio solution file
* CW5-Adapter_UML-Zachary_Rose.dia --> dia file containing the UML showing the inheritance
## Program Usage
To launch the program, clone the repository in Visual Studio and run by pressing "Start".

## Design Decisions
* I kept everything in one file because of how short Main was. The bulk of this program is in the boiler plate classes.
* My print statements were meant to loosely imitate a Pok√©mon battle while still carrying the relevant information.
* I named my imposter bear the "secret grizzly" because no matter how small or cute a bear might be, it's still
a bear that can be very dangerous for humans if we get too close.
